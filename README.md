# Open, Data-driven Science for Decision Makers

## Goal: Enable critical evaluation of research proposals according to the best practices of open science. 

### Rationale
"Open Science" and "Big Data" are popular buzzwords in biological research. A laundry list of publications [REFFS] indicate that many researchers are working on building the skills needed to be computationally savvy biologists. While significant resources are available to help them come up to speed, we are unaware of efforts that target the audience of decision makers who need to be informed about the progress and value of open science and computation. 

We reason that if cutting-edge investigators are only recently navigating through new technologies and practices, there is a wider audience of 'decision makers' who are in a much earlier stage of knowledge acquisition. 

The need of this decision-maker audience is not deep technical knowledge but a broad understanding of relevant topics. An increased understanding of the value and reasoning behind practices and technologies can empower this audience to make more helpful suggestions and critical evaluations of proposals for data-intensive research and/or learning and training strategies. 

####Audience
Funding agencies/program managers, grant reviewers, investigators, and educators who are/will be reviewing research proposals or training curricula that substantially make use of big data and computation in the biological/biomedical sciences.  

**No assumption of familiarity with the technical tools or practices of open science, bioinformatics, computational biology**

##### Format and development
When first deployed, we will teach this as a one-day workshop to a live audience. As the content progresses and we have feedback from an initial presentation, we can evolve the format to be suited for a self-guided course, a virtual webinar, or in-person workshop. 

**Each workshop module will involve:**

- Useful background reading materials and references
- A minimal introductory lecture 
- Hands-on exercises
- Additional learning resources
